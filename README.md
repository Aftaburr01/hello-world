My name is Aftabur Rahman, and I go by Aftab. I was born in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and I currently live in Kansas City, Missouri, with my wife. After high school, I served in the US Army for eight years, which gave me the opportunity to live in various locations across the US and Puerto Rico. 

After raising four children who have all since graduated from college, I've decided to return to school myself. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development with a minor in computer information systems. I'm excited to build a strong foundation in programming, as I ultimately plan to continue my education to earn a master's degree in data science. 

Outside of my studies and career, I enjoy travelingâ€”my wife and I have visited 27 states and 12 countries, and we hope to explore all the state parks in an RV. My other interests include gardening, studying world religions and history, and volunteering. 

I look forward to learning from all of you on this course.
